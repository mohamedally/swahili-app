# swahili-app

Swahili app is an app that teaches a user some simple words and phrases in Swahili language together with their English
translations. The words include numbers 1-10, family members, common colors and common phrases. Once each word item is clicked,
the Swahili pronounciation of the word is played

#  Motivation
 
 I drew inspiration for this project from the Android Basics courses from Udacity's free course catalog. In the udacity course,
 the tutors were developing an app for a language called Miwok. I used the training from this app to adapt the functionality of
 the Miwok App into the Swahili App
